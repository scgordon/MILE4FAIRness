Sites had been burned in severe fires during the summer of 1999, 1987 and 1920. In June 2007, we randomly located a 400 m2 plot (20 m x 20 m) in each site. In each plot, we established a systematic grid for soil sampling and vegetation assessment. Each grid was divided into 100 2.0 m x 2.0 m grid cells. Sampling points were located systematically at 41 of the grid intersections. Within each large plot, two 2.0 m x 2.0 m grid cells were randomly chosen to contain an additional 20 sampling point each. The point layout in these smaller plots was similar to that of the larger scale plots, except the minimum distance between points was 0.5 m rather than 2.0 m. At each sampling location, a 0 to 15 cm depth volumetric soil sample was taken with a 4.5 cm diameter soil core.  At each sampling point, we also measured the depth of the organic layer and buried a mixed-bed resin bag at ca. 5 cm deep to assess resin-available fluxes of inorganic N.  In a 0.25 m2 (50 cm x 50 cm) quadrat centered on each soil sampling point, we assessed percent cover of vegetation and forest floor by species or substrate and measured the distance to the nearest black spruce and/or aspen tree.  LAB:  Soils were homogenized and roots, twigs, and green vegetation were removed by hand. From each soil sample, a sub-sample was used to determine gravimetric moisture content, total C and N initial inorganic nitrogen, initial basal respiration, initial soil microbial biomass and pH. Inorganic nitrogen, soil basal respiration and soil microbial biomass were also measured after a 3-month aerobic laboratory incubation at field moisture and 15 degC. Basal respiration was measured with a Li-Cor (Li-Cor, Ne, USA). Soil microbial biomass was determined with the substrate-induced-respiration (SIR) and was also measured with a Li-Cor. Nitrogen mineralization was determined by extracting soil samples with 0.5 M K2SO4. Nitrogen mineralization in the field was determined using mixed bed resins bags that were extracted with 2M KCL. Ammonium and nitrate concentrations in extracts (field and lab) were determined colorimetrically using an Astoria-Pacific colorimetric autoanalyzer (Astoria, OR, USA). Total soil C and N were measured using a Costech ECS 4010 Elemental Analyzer (Valencia, CA).</literalLayout></para></section></description></methodStep><sampling><studyExtent><coverage scope="document"><temporalCoverage scope="document"><rangeOfDates><beginDate><calendarDate>2007-06-19</calendarDate></beginDate><endDate><calendarDate>2008-06-02</calendarDate></endDate></rangeOfDates></temporalCoverage></coverage></studyExtent><samplingDescription><section><title>Sampling Frequency</title><para><literalLayout>Irregular</literalLayout></para></section></samplingDescription></sampling></methods><access scope="document" order="allowFirst" authSystem="knb"><allow><principal>uid=BNZ,o=lter,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org</principal><permission>all</permission></allow><allow><principal>public</principal><permission>read</permission></allow></access><!--No required data table info found (df_loc/file_name) LEVEL 5--></dataset><additionalMetadata><unitList><unit id="mgN/L"></unit><unit id="pH"></unit><unit id="percentage"></unit><unit id="ÂµgC/gdw/h"></unit><unit id="ÂµgCmic/gdw"></unit><unit id="ÂµgN/gdw"></unit></unitList></additionalMetadata></eml:eml>
